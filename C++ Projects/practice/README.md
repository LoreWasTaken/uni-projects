# Practice
I'll be posting some tests i'll be doing here.
The purpose of this is to solidify and understand C++ concepts better.

	* <details><summary> Test Questions (Click to reveal): </summary>
		a) Program needs to start by printing your Name and Number in the terminal.

		b) Program needs to ask the user for an integer (N) in the interval [3, 15]. The program 				shouldn't accept values out of the interval; values out of range should be ignored and the 		program should continue asking, until the user inputs a valid number. The inserted value 				should be printed in the terminal, in a line that starts with "N=".

		c) Depending on the inserted value, the program should calculate and print the sum of 				**all**   the integers between **3 and N**  including, (being N the value inserted in the 		previous question).

		d) After that it should calculate and print, in one line and in ascending order, the list of 				all its proper divisores of the inserted value (all the integers which divide N, except N 					itself), indicating in the end, with a terminal message, if the inserted number is a prime 				number. A number is prime if it only divides by 1 and by itself.

		e) Consider the following definition of an array `numbers`:
		`int numbers[ ] = {2, 11, 5, 7, 14, 11, 7, 3, 11, 14};`  
		Calculate and print in the terminal the number of times the inserted value N by the user 				appeares in the array.

		f) Consider now the definition of another array `moreNumbers`:
		`int moreNumbers[ ] = {1, 12, 4, 5, 15, 5, 13, 7, 12, 4};`  
		Compare the two arrays, element by element, printing in the terminal a table with the 					result of the comparasion.
