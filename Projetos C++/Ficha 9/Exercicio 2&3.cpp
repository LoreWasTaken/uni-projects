// denis:  Added an option to store the information about all the students in a text file. 
// The fileâ€™s name should be requested to the user. 
// Also added, in order to test the program and verify if the file was correctly created, added
// another option which allows reading student information stored in a file. 
// This option should replace an eventual list of students previously existing in the program. 
// The file's name should be requested to the user.
